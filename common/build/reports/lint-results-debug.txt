/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/common/src/main/res/drawable/empty_event.jpg: Warning: The resource R.drawable.empty_event appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
