        message="The resource `R.drawable.empty_event` appears to be unused"
        category="Performance"

        summary="Unused resources"
        explanation="Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.&#xA;&#xA;The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a test source set instead.&#xA;&#xA;You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude them (usually for performance reasons), use lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.">

        explanation="The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to `drawable-mdpi` and consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in `drawable-ldpi`, `drawable-hdpi` and `drawable-xhdpi`. If the icon **really** is density independent (for example a solid color) you can place it in `drawable-nodpi`."
