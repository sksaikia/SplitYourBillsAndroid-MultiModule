/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/feature_profile/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:4: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 10+ [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/feature_profile/src/main/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]
/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/feature_profile/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26: Warning: This folder configuration (v26) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into mipmap-anydpi. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.
