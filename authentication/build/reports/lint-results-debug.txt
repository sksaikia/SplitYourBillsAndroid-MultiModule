/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/authentication/build.gradle:78: Warning: A newer version of androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose than 1.0.0-alpha03 is available: 1.1.0-alpha01 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose:1.0.0-alpha03"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/authentication/src/main/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]
/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/authentication/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26: Warning: This folder configuration (v26) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into mipmap-anydpi. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.
