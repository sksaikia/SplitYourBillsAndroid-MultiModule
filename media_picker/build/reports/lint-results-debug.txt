/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/media_picker/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:5: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 10+ [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.
