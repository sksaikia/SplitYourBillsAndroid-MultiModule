/Users/sourav/AndroidStudioProjects/SplitYourBillsAndroid/contact_picker/src/main/res/drawable/ic_user.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/ic_user.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
